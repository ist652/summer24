    "The final project for IST652 involves locating an open data set or a group of data sets of interest, formulating an inquiry or set of inquiries that could be addressed with the data,processing the data set(s) in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python, and conducting some analyses on the data to illuminate the inquiry. The project focuses on open data in order to ensure that your chain of transformations and analysis is\n",
