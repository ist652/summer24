    "#### NumPy is a powerful numerical computing library for Python that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

    "\n",
    "1. `a = a.reshape(3, 2)`: This line of code uses the `reshape()` function to modify the shape of the variable `a`. It reshapes `a` into a 3x2 matrix, meaning it will have 3 rows and 2 columns. The reshaping operation is performed in-place, meaning the original array `a` is modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `a`: This is a variable that holds a NumPy array. The array could be of any shape or size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `reshape()`: This is a function provided by the NumPy library. It allows you to change the shape of a NumPy array without modifying its data. The `reshape()` function takes the desired shape as arguments and returns a new array with the specified shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `a.reshape(3, 2)`: In this line of code, the `reshape()` function is called on the variable `a`. It specifies the desired shape of the array as `(3, 2)`, indicating that the resulting array should have 3 rows and 2 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `a = a.reshape(3, 2)`: **The reshaped array is then assigned back to the variable `a`. This means that the original array `a` is replaced with the reshaped array.** If you were to print the value of `a` after this line, you would see the reshaped array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases and Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reshape()` function is commonly used in data manipulation tasks, especially when dealing with multidimensional arrays or matrices. Here are more examples to illustrate its functionality:\n",

    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[1 2 3]\n",
    " [4 5 6]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the original array `a` is reshaped into a 2x3 matrix. The resulting matrix is printed, showing the reshaped values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n",
    "a = a.reshape(6)\n",

    "### Code Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `a.sum(axis=1)`: This code calculates the sum of elements along the rows of the array or matrix `a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure:\n",
    "- `a`: represents the input array or matrix on which the sum operation is performed.\n",
    "- `.sum(axis=1)`: method called on the array `a` to calculate the sum along a specific axis. In this case, `axis=1` specifies that the sum should be calculated along the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality:\n",
    "- The code calculates the sum of elements along the rows of the array or matrix `a`. Each row is treated as a separate entity, and the sum is calculated by adding up all the elements within each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it Works:\n",
    "- When `a.sum(axis=1)` is executed, it iterates over each row of the array `a` and calculates the sum of the elements in that row.\n",
    "- The result is returned as a new array or a single-dimensional array (depending on the shape of `a`) containing the sums of each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `axis=1` parameter allows flexibility to perform operations along different axes, such as calculating column-wise sums (`axis=0`) or even sums across higher-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "              [4, 5, 6],\n",
    "              [7, 8, 9]])\n",
    "\n",
    "row_sums = a.sum(axis=1)\n",
    "print(row_sums)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ 6 15 24]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the input matrix `a` has three rows. The code calculates the sum of each row, resulting in the array `[6, 15, 24]`. This means that the sum of the elements in the first row is 6, in the second row is 15, and in the third row is 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases:\n",
    "- This functionality can be used in various domains, such as data analysis, scientific computing, machine learning, and more.\n",
    "- It can be utilized to compute row-wise statistics, identify patterns, analyze trends, or perform data aggregations along the rows of a matrix or array.\n",

    "**Description:**\n",
    "This code performs a sum operation on the array `a` along a specific axis and keeps the dimensions of the result unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "The `sum` method is used with two parameters: `axis` and `keepdims`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. `a.sum`: This part calls the `sum` method on the array `a`. The `sum` method computes the sum of elements along a specified axis.\n",
    "2. `axis=1`: The `axis` parameter specifies the axis along which the sum operation is performed. In this case, `axis=1` indicates that the sum is calculated along the second axis (columns) of the array `a`.\n",
    "3. `keepdims=True`: The `keepdims` parameter is set to `True`, which means the dimensions of the resulting array will be the same as the original array `a`. It preserves the shape of the array, including the dimensions that were summed over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notable Features/Functionality:**\n",
    "- The `sum` method allows you to perform summation along a specific axis of a multi-dimensional array.\n",
    "- By specifying `axis=1`, you are summing the elements in each row.\n",
    "- Setting `keepdims=True` ensures that the resulting array maintains the same dimensions as the original array, with a single dimension for the sum results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples/Use Cases:**\n",
    "Let's consider an example to better understand the code's functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "sum_result = a.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)\n",
    "print(sum_result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[ 6]\n",
    " [15]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a 2-dimensional array `a` with two rows and three columns. By calling `a.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)`, we perform a sum operation along the second axis (columns), which gives us the sum of elements in each row. The resulting array `sum_result` preserves the shape with dimensions `(2, 1)`, where each row contains the sum of elements in the corresponding row of the original array `a`.\n",
