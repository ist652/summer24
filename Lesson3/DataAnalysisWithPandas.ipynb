    "## What is Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python library for data analysis. The homepage of Pandas is http://pandas.pydata.org/.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas takes the pain and suffering out of data analysis by doing a lot of the work for you. Pandas is so elegant at times, people feel it's \"indistinguishable from magic.\" In this lesson we will try to our best to explain what Pandas is doing \"behind the curtain\" and expose the magic behind Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas library gets its name not from the furry Asian animal, but from the words \"Panel Data\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is data analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analysis is the process of systematically applying statistical and/or logical techniques to describe and illustrate, condense and recap, and evaluate data [https://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/n_illinois_u/datamanagement/datopic.html](https://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/n_illinois_u/datamanagement/datopic.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of data analysis are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. discover useful information,\n",
    "2. provide insights,\n",
    "3. suggest conclusions, and\n",
    "4. support decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Most data analysis problems start with a fundamental question (but they don't always have to). Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do students who study in groups perform better on examinations that those who study alone?\n",
    "- What role (if any at all) does weather play in consumer shopping habits?\n",
    "- What types of passengers were most likely to survive the Titantic?\n",
    "- Among American Football teams who \"go for it\" on 4th downs, what is their win percentage?\n",
    "- Are we stocking products in warehouses closest to the customers who purchase them?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data analysis is \"information storytelling\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't think of data analysis as crunching numbers and churning out graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to think of data analysis as \"information storytelling.\" Unlike slapping a chart on a powerpoint slide, which might be the *result* of a data analysis, it's a full disclosure of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. helping the reader understand your methodology (how you acquired and prepared the data)\n",
    "2. sharing your complete analysis (including things that didn't work)\n",
    "3. provding a narrative as to what the results mean, and most importantly\n",
    "4. providing an honest and accurate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why perform a data analysis with Code?\n",
    "\n",
    "You **could** do this in Excel, but Code (Python) and Jupyter Notebook offer several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is easier to automate and update the process later on, since its code.\n",
    "- You can intermix code witha narrative / explanations in the Jupyter notebook\n",
    "- It can integrate with a variety of services and systems (because its code!).\n",
    "- What you create is reproduceable. Someone else can run your code and see your results. This provdes stronger evidence to support your analysis as opposed to just a chart on a powerpoint slide!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is a skill every information professional should have, and this is a primary reason we teach programming in the iSchool. When you can code it makes performing a data analysis that much better!"

    "### 1.A Import pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use `pandas` you must import it into Python. When we import Pandas it is customary to use the alias `pd` so that we don't have to type `pandas` in our code. For example instead of typing `pandas.DataFrame()` we can save ourselves a few keystrokes with `pd.DataFrame()`\n",

(nan means \"Not a Number\") Since these values are absent they are not included in numerical calculations. This is important for getting the \"math\" right, as we will see later on. "
